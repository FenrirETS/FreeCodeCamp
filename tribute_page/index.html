    <p>Robin Pecknold was born in Seattle in 1986. He is said to have written his first song at the age of 14. The song is called "Sarah Jane" and tells the story of a runaway who turns to prostitution. Pecknold released the song along with six others as
      a demo CD called St. Vincent Street around his hometown as Robin Noel Vaas. Later, the music of Bob Dylan would become Pecknold's primary influence. In 2005, Pecknold toured as a bassist with Seattle's Dolour. Pecknold formed Fleet Foxes in 2006
      with Skyler Skjelset. He knew Skjelset from school, where they already played original music together. He reportedly ran up considerable debt setting up the band. Besides his work with Fleet Foxes, Pecknold has used the moniker White Antelope for
      solo output, releasing covers of traditional songs, including "Silver Dagger", "Wild Mountain Thyme" and "False Knight on the Road". He also started a band with sister Aja, called Rainbow Fang, and has worked with Past Lives' Morgan Henderson on
      "film score-type music". In early 2011, footage emerged of Pecknold as a teenager covering Radiohead's "Let Down" and Simon and Garfunkel's "America", along with another musician named Aaron Mannino. On March 7, 2011, Pecknold released three solo
      songs on Twitter together as Three Songs, including two original compositions, one a duet with Ed Droste, and a cover of Chris Thompson's (http://www.expdev.net/htownwiki/index.php/Chris_Thompson) "Where Is My Wild Rose?". In February 2012, Pecknold,
      along with Morgan Henderson and Neal Morgan, recorded music for Sara Lamm and Mary Wigmore's film about Ina May Gaskin, Birth Story: Ina May Gaskin and the Farm Midwives. On October 22, 2013, Pecknold appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon to
      perform a cover of Pearl Jam's "Corduroy" with Daniel Rossen and Neal Morgan. In January 2014, Robin Pecknold toured as part of the supergroup The Gene Clark No Other Band, performing Gene Clark's album No Other in full with other singers including
      Iain Matthews, Victoria Legrand, Daniel Rossen and Hamilton Leithauser. In January 2015, Pecknold's latest project was an off-Broadway play, entitled "Wyoming", for which he wrote the score.</p>
